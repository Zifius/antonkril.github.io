	<h1>ยง 1. On code reuse</h1>
	<p>There are 2 main types of code reuse mechanisms: static (inheritance, traits) & dynamic (aggregation)</p>
	<p>Static code reuse mechanisms are usually convenient but they hard-code reused behavior and thus prevent it's customizations</p>
	<p>Dynamic mechanisms are often more verbose but allow customization.</p>
